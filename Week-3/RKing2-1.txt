If I want to get a story on the evening news:  

	The tagline for my news story would be “Did you know that women have a 50% chance of going 40 weeks or more in their first pregnancy?  
	That story after we return 	from these messages.

	<after returning from commercials>

	That’s right.  According to the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) study, on average women who give birth to their first child have a 50% chance of
	having a late	pregnancy.  And even more surprising is that according to the NSFG study women have over a 1 in 10 chance (12.3%) of going at least 42 weeks!  Can
	you believe that!  Get ready for many sleepless, uncomfortable nights first time mothers.

Statistics I would use if I wanted to reassure an anxious patient:

	There is nothing to be worried about really.  Listen to this information from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth about first pregnancies:  Of all the first
	pregnancies that resulted in live births, the average pregnancy length was 38.6 weeks.  The average pregnancy length for second pregnancies and beyond is 38.5
	weeks.  So really, there’s not that much of a difference in terms of pregnancy length between your first child and other children.

Do first babies arrive late?

	Cecil replies:

	It is all about the perspective that you are willing to give to the word late.  I am not sure if you’ve heard the adage before but “if you are five minutes early,
	you are already ten minutes late” (shout out to Vince Lombardi).  But we’re talking about the first pregnancy, not practice (Allen Iverson anyone?).  The 2002
	National Survey of Family Growth shows that the difference in pregnancy length between first born children and other born children is a whopping 13 hours.
	Considering that the average pregnancy (first and other) is 6,468 hours long, 13 hours seems rather irrelevant, no?  So to answer the question, yes, first babies
	arrive late, but no, not really.
